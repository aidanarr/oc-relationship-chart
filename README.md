# OC Relationship Chart

Welcome to my **OC (original character) Relationship Chart**. Here you can find an index of my original characters (and some guests characters too) and their relationships.

## Technologies
This application has been built with React + Vite, styles were given using SCSS. To run the app, write the commands `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

## How it works
The home screen will show a list of all available characters. Click on any of them to go to their relationships page. The color of the diagram lines represents their relationship type. Hover on the main character to see more info about them. You can also hover on the related characters to see more details about their relationship, or click on them to jump to their relationship page. Click the credits button to go to the credits page, where you'll see all the characters classified by creator.

Thanks for taking a look! :white_heart:
